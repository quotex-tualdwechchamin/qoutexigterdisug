speculate on the price movements of assets such as currencies,
commodities, and cryptocurrencies.

With Quotex, you can trade digital options with a variety of underlying
assets, including:

-   Currencies (e.g., EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY)
-   Commodities (e.g., gold, silver, oil)
-   Cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin)
-   Indices (e.g., S&P 500, FTSE 100, Nikkei 225)

## How does Quotex work?

When you trade digital options with Quotex, you are essentially making a
prediction about whether the price of an asset will rise or fall within
a certain time frame. If your prediction is correct, you will profit
from the trade. If your prediction is incorrect, you will lose your
investment.

The profit potential of digital options trading can be high, but so is
the risk. It is important to remember that you can lose your entire
investment when trading digital options.
